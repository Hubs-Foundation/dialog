# dialog
Mediasoup based WebRTC SFU for Hubs.

## Development
1. Clone repo
2. In root project folder, `npm ci` (this may take a while).
3. Create a folder in the root project folder called `certs` if needed (see steps 4 & 5).
4. Add the ssl cert and key to the `certs` folder as `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`, or set the path to these in your shell via `HTTPS_CERT_FULLCHAIN` and `HTTPS_CERT_PRIVKEY` respectively. You can provide these certs yourself or use the ones available in https://github.com/Hubs-Foundation/reticulum/tree/master/priv (`dev-ssl.cert` and `dev-ssl.key`).

5. Add the reticulum permissions public key to the `certs` folder as `perms.pub.pem`, or set the path to the file in your shell via `AUTH_KEY`.

  * If using one of the public keys from hubs-ops (located in https://github.com/Hubs-Foundation/hubs-ops/tree/master/ansible/roles/janus/files), you will need to convert it to standard pem format.    
    * e.g. for use with dev.reticulum.io:  `openssl rsa -in perms.pub.der.dev -inform DER -RSAPublicKey_in -out perms.pub.pem`

6. Start dialog with `MEDIASOUP_LISTEN_IP=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX npm start` where `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` is the local IP address of the machine running the server. (In the case of a VM, this should be the internal IP address of the VM).
  * If you choose to set the paths for `HTTPS_CERT_FULLCHAIN`, `HTTPS_CERT_PRIVKEY` and/or `AUTH_KEY` you may also define them inline here as well. e.g. 
  ```
  HTTPS_CERT_FULLCHAIN=/path/to/cert.file HTTPS_CERT_PRIVKEY=/path/to/key.file AUTH_KEY=/path/to/auth.key MEDIASOUP_LISTEN_IP=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX MEDIASOUP_ANNOUNCED_IP=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX npm start
  ```
     
7. Navigate to https://localhost:4443/ in your browser, and accept the self-signed cert.

8. You may now point Hubs/Reticulum to use `localhost:4443` as the WebRTC host/port.`

See `config.js` for all available configuration options.
